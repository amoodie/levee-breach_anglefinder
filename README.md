This program was built on top of `matplotlib`, using the package for interactivity and for image display.
The code is supplied with the hope that it may be helpful to getting started in adapting something similar for their own needs.

## Using LBAF
Let `run_finder.py` be an example for how you can import the package and run it.


## Limitations
 * only one record per image
 * datatable is loaded into memory and written on each new entry
 * limited documentation
