# levee-breach angle finder

## Description
This program was built on top of `matplotlib`, using the package for interactivity and for image display.

There is currently a limited IO for the package, and some content is hardcoded. 
The code is supplied such that it may help someone get started in adapting something similar for their own needs.


## Limitations
 * only one record per image
 * data is loaded into memory and written on each new entry
